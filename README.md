# Memory String Game
We developers often find ourselves having to work with the strangest of strings, usually in an ugodly mixture of uppercase, lowercase and possibly klingon. In all seriousness though, it is quite useful if you're able to look at unfamiliar combinations of characters and remember them in one shot - rather than having to keep switching back and forth. It can save you lots of time.

This is a little utility I developed to take my brain muscles to the gym. It shows you a random word of length your choosing. Your aim is to simply commit it to memory and repeat it. The catch? Well as soon as you start typing.. the word disappears leaving you to recall it all on your own. You can adjust the word length using the number box provided or simply key up and down.
